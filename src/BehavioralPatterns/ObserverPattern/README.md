# Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern, also known as the Publish-Subscribe pattern, Model-View pattern, Source-Listener pattern, or Dependents pattern, establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. It allows multiple dependent objects to be notified and automatically updated whenever the state of an object changes.

A change in the state or behavior of one object will result in changes in the state or behavior of other objects, creating a linkage between them.

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing changes in one object to affect other objects.

Therefore, the Observer Pattern consists of four roles: `Subject`, `Concrete Subject`, `Observer`, and `Concrete Observer`.
